                  <h3>Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility.
                    <br><br>
                    1. Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while   holding a pose can build strength. 
                    <br><br>
                    2. Yoga helps with back pain relief. 
                    <br><br>
                    Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.
                    3. Yoga can ease arthritis symptoms. 
                    <br><br>
                    Gentle yoga has been shown to ease some of the discomfort of tender, swollen joints for people with arthritis, according to a Johns Hopkins review of 11 recent studies.
                    <br><br>
                    4. Yoga benefits heart health. 
                    Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts. Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed through yoga. <br><br>
                    5. Yoga relaxes you, to help you sleep better.
                    Research shows that a consistent bedtime yoga routine can help you get in the right mindset and prepare your body to fall asleep and stay asleep. 
                    <br><br>
                    6. Yoga can mean more energy and brighter moods.
                    You may feel increased mental and physical energy, a boost in alertness and enthusiasm, and fewer negative feelings after getting into a routine of practicing yoga.
                    <br><br>
                    7. Yoga helps you manage stress. 
                    According to the National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence shows that yoga supports stress management, mental health, mindfulness, healthy eating, weight loss and quality sleep.
                    <br><br>
                    8. Yoga connects you with a supportive community. 
                    Participating in yoga classes can ease loneliness and provide an environment for group healing and support. Even during one-on-one sessions loneliness is reduced as one is acknowledged as a unique individual, being listened to and participating in the creation of a personalized yoga plan.
                    <br><br>
                    9. Yoga promotes better self-care.

                Try it: Tree Pose <br>
                <br>Balance on one foot, while holding the other foot to your calf or above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle. Try to focus on one spot in front of you, while you balance for one minute. 
                <br><br>
                Get into position. Tree pose often starts from mountain pose (or Tadasana), with both feet planted firmly on the ground and your weight adequately distributed so that you are balanced.
                Bend one leg at the knee. Choose the leg you are going to fold in first. If your left leg is your standing leg, keep your left foot planted on the ground, and slowly bend in your right leg at the right knee so that the sole of your right foot rests against your left inner thigh (known as the half-lotus position in Bikram yoga). Point the knee of your bent leg outward, away from your body.
                Lengthen your body. Clasp your hands together in Anjali Mudra (also called the “prayer position”) and raise your arms above your head. In this form, your head, shoulders, pelvis, and left foot should align vertically. The top of your torso should lift slightly, with your tailbone extending towards the ground.
                Hold and repeat. Hold the pose for as long as necessary, making sure to breathe properly. When you’re ready to switch legs, exhale, and return to mountain pose to start again.

                <br><br>
                Get on all fours, placing your palms underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. First, inhale, as you let your stomach drop down toward the floor. Then, exhale, as you draw your navel toward your spine, arching your spine like a cat stretching. 
                <br><br>
                Begin on your hands and knees in table pose, with a neutral spine. As you inhale and move into cow pose, lift your sit bones upward, press your chest forward and allow your belly to sink.
                Lift your head, relax your shoulders away from your ears, and gaze straight ahead.
                As you exhale, come into cat pose while rounding your spine outward, tucking in your tailbone, and drawing your pubic bone forward.
                Release your head toward the floor — just don’t force your chin to your chest. Most importantly, just relax.

                Try it: Downward Dog Pose <br><br>
                Get on all fours, then tuck your toes under and bring your sitting bones up, so that you make a triangle shape. Keep a slight bend in your knees, while lengthening your spine and tailbone.
                    <br><br>
                On a yoga mat, begin in Downward-Facing Dog Pose. To do this, start on all fours and place your hands in front of you on the mat (palms down). Press into your hands and feet, straighten your legs, and raise your hips up towards the sky. Your body will be in an upside-down V position.
                Next, raise your right leg off the ground and bring your right knee to the back of your right wrist. Then, rotate your right shin so that it’s parallel with the front of your mat.
                As you bring your right leg to the mat, keep your left leg straight as it reaches the ground.
                Bring your right knee outward so it’s farther to the right than your hips and ensure your right foot is dorsiflexed (flexed toward the shin). Gently lower your right buttocks towards the ground, but ensure you’re keeping your weight equally distributed between both hips. If this is too difficult, place a folded towel underneath your right buttocks.
                Place both hands under your shoulders and gently press into the palms of your hands to straighten and elongate your spine. Look straight forward and feel the stretch. At this point, you have achieved Classic Pigeon Pose.
                Next, take a deep breath and as you exhale, lower your torso over your right leg, and stretch your arms straight in front of you, with your elbows slightly bent. Place your forehead either on a yoga block or on your forearms crossed in front. If this is uncomfortable for you, simply reach forward as far as you’re comfortable.
                Gently bring your shoulders back away from your ears in a relaxed position.
                Hold this position for 5–10 slow, deep breaths.
                Repeat on the other side.

                Sit down normally on the floor. (If you are not used to sitting on the floor or you are uncomfortable, then keep one thick folded blanket on the floor for firm and flat base for sitting). Stretch out your legs ahead in front.
                Now cross your legs and broaden your knees, in order that you can slip your both foot under the opposite knee.
                After that you have to bend your knees along with fold your legs.
                Keep your feet loose, in order that the external edges lay on the floor and the inner curves are settled beneath the inverse leg.
                Your thighs and crossed legs ought to frame a little triangle. Keep some space between your feet and pelvis.
                Now sit with your buttock in a neutral position. (For this, you have to press your hands opposing the ground and lift your sitting bones a bit). Attempt to hold for a breath or two and after that gradually bring down yourself back on to the floor.
                Balance your tail bone and pubic bone in a manner that they are equidistant from the floor.
                Keep your hands on your knees with palm facing down and expand your tailbone against the floor. (You can keep your hands in Gyan mudra).
